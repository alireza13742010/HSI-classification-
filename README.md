# HSI-classification-
Hyperspectral Image (HSI) Recognition 
# Introduction 
<p align="justify"> Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that collects and processes information across the electromagnetic spectrum to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in an image. This allows for the identification of objects and materials by analyzing their unique spectral signatures. </p>

<summary>Methodology</summary>
<p align="justify"> This repository investigates the possibility of combining a convolutional neural network with a machine learning model to predict classes using HSI pictures. The proposed methodology uses famous CNN models such as VGG16, Inception, and Densenet by changing the pooling layers inside their model architecture. The feature extraction model is followed by the ML models such as KNN, SVM, and LR. The proposed methodology is evaluated using Indian_pines and PaviaU datasets. </p>
